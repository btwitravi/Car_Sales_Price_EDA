# Car_Sales_Price_EDA

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a car sales dataset to uncover insights about car prices, mileage, brand performance, and sales distribution across different regions and years.  
All visualizations are created using **Matplotlib**, and the analysis highlights both **Price** and **Kilometers (Distance)** as the main KPIs.
